                <h2><b>Q1:</b> What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
                <p><b>Ans:</b> Session Storage and local Storage properties and methods are roughly the same. The session storage object is used much less than the local storage object. sessionStorage exists only in the browser Current tab. And local storage saves the data in the browser</p>

                <h2><b>Q2:</b> What is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h2>
                <p><b>Ans:</b> Block scoping means declaring a variable, not just inside a function, but around any curly brackets like if statements or loops. The variable itself let i is still in memory, but the engine just won't allow you to access. The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program executes by default.</p>

                <h2><b>Q3:</b> What is the JavaScript event loop?</h2>
                <p><b>Ans:</b> The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed.</p>

                <h2><b>Q4:</b> How many ways can we get undefined in javascript?</h2>
                <p><b>Ans:</b> A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
